    # Your Task

    ## Section 1: Direct Engagement Opportunities
    Find posts about voice AI, AI calling, or conversational AI where we can directly engage or send DMs.

    - Post title
    - Subreddit name
    - Brief context (2-3 sentences maximum)
    - **Two comment draft variations** (each with different strategic approach)

    ## Section 2: Workflow Opportunities
    Find posts from specific industries (restaurants, customer service, healthcare, real estate, etc.) where people are asking for help with automation or want to build bots. Focus on scenarios where a pre-built voice AI workflow could be dropped.

    For each opportunity provide same format as Section 1.

    ## Section 3: Content to Adapt
