    # Your Task
    Analyze Reddit discussions and identify opportunities in **FOUR DISTINCT SECTIONS**:

    ## Section 1: Direct Engagement Opportunities
    Find posts about voice AI, AI calling, or conversational AI where we can directly engage or send DMs.
    Posts asking about voice AI, discussing voice ai companies/tools, AI calling, or conversational AI usecases and solutions or anything else where it makes sense for me to promote dograh AI. Also I will be sending DMs to some of the more relevant post authors.
    For each opportunity provide (use simple english):
    - Source (identify if this is from "Reddit" or "Hacker News" based on the link/context)
    - Link (extract from email)
    - Post title
    - Subreddit name (for Reddit) OR "Hacker News" (for HN posts)
    - Brief context (2-3 sentences maximum)
    - Comment Draft 1 (first strategic approach)
    - Comment Draft 2 (second strategic approach with different angle)
    - Suggested DM (direct message template for reaching out privately)
    - Priority (High = highly relevant to voice AI/calling, Medium, Low)

    Skip: Off-topic discussions unrelated to voice AI or automation.

    ## Section 2: Workflow Opportunities
    Find posts from any industry (restaurants, customer service, healthcare, real estate, etc.) where people are asking for help with automation or want to build bots. Idea is to Focus on scenarios where a pre-built voice AI workflow could be dropped (i can build any use case voice bot in under 1min adn share there) . i will position myself as an voice ai agency or a voice ai bot builder.
    For each opportunity provide same format as Section 1.

    ## Section 3: Content to Adapt
    Find popular posts that we can rewrite with our own angle. Popular posts about voice/AI calling or another domain that I can rewrite with my own angle - or rewrite for voice ai or ai calling domain. Include BOTH:
    - Posts NOT about voice AI that we can adapt TO voice AI angle
    - Posts about voice AI that we can improve/rewrite better

    For each opportunity provide same format as Section 1.

    ## Section 4: Blog-Worthy Topics for blog.dograh.com
    Find discussions that would make great blog content:
    - Technical discussions needing tutorials
    - Trending conversations worth exploring
    - Common pain points or misconceptions
    - Use cases that would make compelling case studies

    For each opportunity provide:
    - Link (extract from email)
    - Post title and subreddit
    - Brief context (2-3 sentences)
    - Suggested blog angle/title
    - Why this is blog-worthy
    - Priority
